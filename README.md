# Metacrafters_ETH-PROOF-Beginner_Token
This Solidity program serves as a submission for the final assessment for ETH-PROOF Beginner in which the requirement is to create a token that has burn and mint function.

Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a two functions, to mint tokens, meaning to generate more supply, or to burn, meaning to decrease supply.

Getting Started
Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, drag and drop the Token.sol in your workspace. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code inside Token.sol to a new file in your workspace.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Token.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Token" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the Burn or Mint function.
